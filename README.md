# Food-Delivery-Cost-and-Profitability-Analysis
Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis is a comprehensive evaluation aimed at understanding and optimizing the financial dynamics of a food delivery operation. The goal is to identify areas where the service can reduce costs, increase revenue, and implement pricing or commission strategies that enhance profitability.
Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis involves examining all the costs associated with delivering food orders, from direct expenses like delivery fees and packaging to indirect expenses like discounts offered to customers and commission fees paid by restaurants. By juxtaposing these costs against the revenue generated (primarily through order values and commission fees), the analysis aims to provide insights into how profitable the food delivery service is on a per-order basis.

Below is the process we can follow for the task of Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis:

Start by gathering comprehensive data related to all aspects of food delivery operations.
Clean the dataset for inconsistencies, missing values, or irrelevant information.
Extract relevant features that could impact cost and profitability.
Break down the costs associated with each order, including fixed costs (like packaging) and variable costs (like delivery fees and discounts).
Determine the revenue generated from each order, focusing on commission fees and the order value before discounts.
For each order, calculate the profit by subtracting the total costs from the revenue. Analyze the distribution of profitability across all orders to identify trends.
Based on the cost and profitability analysis, develop strategic recommendations aimed at enhancing profitability.
Use the data to simulate the financial impact of proposed changes, such as adjusting discount or commission rates.
So, the process starts with collecting a dataset. I found an ideal dataset for this task.

#Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis using Python

#Import the dataset
#perform data cleaning and preparation
Convert “Order Date and Time” and “Delivery Date and Time” to a datetime format.
Convert “Discounts and Offers” to a consistent numeric value (if applicable) or calculate the discount amounts.
Ensure all monetary values are in a suitable format for calculations.

#Cost and Profitability Analysis
For the cost analysis, we’ll consider the following costs associated with each order:

Delivery Fee: The fee charged for delivering the order.
Payment Processing Fee: The fee for processing the payment.
Discount Amount: The discount provided on the order.

#The histogram shows a wide distribution of profit per order, with a noticeable number of orders resulting in a loss (profits below 0). The red dashed line indicates the average profit, which is in the negative territory, highlighting the overall loss-making situation.

#The pie chart illustrates the breakdown of total costs into delivery fees, payment processing fees, and discount amounts. Discounts constitute a significant portion of the costs, suggesting that promotional strategies might be heavily impacting overall profitability.

#The bar chart compares total revenue, total costs, and total profit. It visually represents the gap between revenue and costs, clearly showing that the costs surpass the revenue, leading to a total loss.

#The visualization compares the distribution of profitability per order using actual discounts and commissions versus the simulated scenario with recommended discounts (6%) and commissions (30%).
